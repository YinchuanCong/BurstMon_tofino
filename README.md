# BurstMon: Microsecond-Level Burst-Aware Traffic Monitoring via Programmable Switches

In modern high-speed networks, bursty traffic variations—sudden surges or drops—often occur at microsecond granularity, impacting congestion control, anomaly detection, and QoS. However, existing monitoring systems operate at millisecond-level resolution and miss fine-grained dynamics. Uploading measurements at microsecond scale is communication-intensive and impractical.
We propose \textbf{BurstMon}, a microsecond-level burst detection and flow reconstruction system for programmable switch data planes. BurstMon is based on a key observation: most flows are stable, punctuated by short bursts. 
It detects burst points in traffic streams in real time within the data plane and reports only minimal metadata—flow ID, timestamp, and rate—to the control plane. 
The control plane reconstructs the full flow rate via linear interpolation, preserving traffic dynamics while minimizing communication overhead.
To support accurate and efficient in-switch processing, BurstMon introduces three innovations: (1) a lightweight chi-square-based burst detection algorithm with low computational cost; (2) a \textit{time-sketch} structure with 3 sketch rotation scheme to to ensure state isolation and accurate measurement across continuous windows; and (3) a hybrid approximation technique using lookup tables and logarithmic projections to support complex arithmetic in data plane.
We implement BurstMon on the Intel Tofino switch. Under a 10~$\mu$s measurement window, it achieves over 95\% flow reconstruction accuracy (cosine similarity), incurs around 0.06~Gbps control-plane overhead, and introduces negligible forwarding impact. 
BurstMon enables practical, scalable microsecond-level traffic streams monitoring—offering new capabilities for real-time visibility and anomaly detection in data center and backbone networks.
